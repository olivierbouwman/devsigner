TODO
* batch script to loop terminal commands with a 10 second pause in between.
* change resolution to 1920x1080 for HD projector
* possibly use image age for something so newer images are more prominent than older images (need to load photo timestamp from json files in image dir)
* some photos are not square, crop? look for this in instagram scraper and comment out: # get non-square image if one exists
* only include images in generate_file_list.py
