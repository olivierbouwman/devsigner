TODO
* batch script to loop terminal commands with a 10 second pause in between.
* change resolution to 1920x1080 for HD projector
* possibly use image age for something so newer images are more prominent than older images (need to load photo timestamp from json files in image dir)
* some photos are not square, crop? look for this in instagram scraper and comment out: # get non-square image if one exists
  * ctx.drawImage(image,
    10, 10,   // Start at 10 pixels from the left and the top of the image (crop),
    80, 30,   // "Get" a `80 * 30` (w * h) area from the source image (crop),
    0, 0,     // Place the result at 0, 0 in the canvas,
    160, 60); // With as width / height: 160 * 60 (scale)
